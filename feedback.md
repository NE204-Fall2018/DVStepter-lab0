# Overall (87/100)
 - Careful... plagarism filters went off on the intro. Probably related to this
   being based on the in-class example we did, but beware!

# Build (10/10)
 - Good instructions in README
 - Way to go above-and-beyond with the checksumming!
 - Consider adding list of dependencies (e.g. astropy) and specifying your
   python environment (what version of python are you running, etc.)

# Testing (10/10)
 - The command you implemented in your Makefile was not actually running the
   test suite... see modifications in commit 3ca84dc

# Introduction / Motivation / Background (15/15)
 - Adequate for lab 0, for future labs make sure to focus on the what and the
   why

# Methods (12/15)
 - Okay description of your approach, but more detail on the algorithms, esp.
   the ones that are original to the lab (peak finding, for example) would be
   better. Adequate for lab 0, but should have more concrete presentation for
   future labs.

# Results and Discussion (30/40)
 - Good figures, appropriately labelled, legends, axes, titles etc.
 - Generally, want to make sure your figures are conveying relevant and 
   interesting information.
 - Be careful with the sig-figs: you are claiming way more precision than is
   supported by your analyses.

# Conclusion (10/10)
 - Don't necessarily need a separate conclusion section: discussion can serve
   the purpose here.
 - For future labs, would like a greater level of discussion on your results 
   and the limitations of your approach.

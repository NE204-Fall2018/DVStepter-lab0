The purpose of Lab0 is to practice generating lab reports using the reproducible work flow required for NE204: Advanced Concepts in Radiation Detection. Energy calibration of a HPGe detector, a ubiquitous task in radiation detection laboratories, will be used as an example for practicing the work flow. You must implement an approach to downloading data (see next section), extract the
spectral information, and use it to develop a model for energy calibration. The energy calibration
will then be evaluated using (at least) one of the datasets that was not used in the calibration
procedure. These results, along with any relevant discussion, are to be included in the lab writeup.

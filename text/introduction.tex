The purpose of Lab0 is to practice generating lab reports using the reproducible work flow required for NE204: Advanced Concepts in Radiation Detection. Energy calibration of a HPGe detector, a ubiquitous task in radiation detection laboratories, was used as an example for practicing the work flow. In Lab0 this energy calibration was done using a two-point linear calibration between two gamma-ray photopeaks of $^{137}$Cs and $^{241}$Am. Subsequently, the calibration model was "verified" by applying it to a third gamma-ray photopeak from $^{133}$Ba. This report details the process and results of a two-point linear calibration.

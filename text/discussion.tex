A linear energy calibration model for a coaxial HPGe detector was successfully produced using reproducible workflows. The accuracy of the calibration was determined by applying the model to the $^{133}$Ba dataset. While Knoll~\cite{knoll2010radiation} suggests using a polynomial fit, the approximation error between the calibrated and expected energies was insignificant; indicative of a very reliable model. The highest error, a $\delta$ of 0.164359(\%), occurred at the 80.9979 keV photopeak. This is likely due a large channel width creating an inability to discriminate between the 80.9979 keV and 79.6142 keV photopeaks in $^{133}$Ba.
